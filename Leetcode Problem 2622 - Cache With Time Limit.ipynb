    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a class that allows getting and setting key-value pairs, however a time until expiration is associated with each key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class has three public methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "set(key, value, duration): accepts an integer key, an integer value, and a duration in milliseconds. Once the duration has elapsed, the key should be inaccessible. The method should return true if the same un-expired key already exists and false otherwise. Both the value and duration should be overwritten if the key already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "get(key): if an un-expired key exists, it should return the associated value. Otherwise it should return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "count(): returns the count of un-expired keys.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \n",
    "actions = [\"TimeLimitedCache\", \"set\", \"get\", \"count\", \"get\"]\n",
    "values = [[], [1, 42, 100], [1], [], [1]]\n",
    "timeDelays = [0, 0, 50, 50, 150]\n",
    "Output: [null, false, 42, 1, -1]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "At t=0, the cache is constructed.\n",
    "At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 100ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.\n",
    "At t=50, key=1 is requested and the value of 42 is returned.\n",
    "At t=50, count() is called and there is one active key in the cache.\n",
    "At t=100, key=1 expires.\n",
    "At t=150, get(1) is called but -1 is returned because the cache is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \n",
    "actions = [\"TimeLimitedCache\", \"set\", \"set\", \"get\", \"get\", \"get\", \"count\"]\n",

    "Output: [null, false, true, 50, 50, -1, 0]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "At t=0, the cache is constructed.\n",
    "At t=0, a key-value pair (1: 42) is added with a time limit of 50ms. The value doesn't exist so false is returned.\n",
    "At t=40, a key-value pair (1: 50) is added with a time limit of 100ms. A non-expired value already existed so true is returned and the old value was overwritten.\n",
    "At t=50, get(1) is called which returned 50.\n",
    "At t=120, get(1) is called which returned 50.\n",
    "At t=140, key=1 expires.\n",
    "At t=200, get(1) is called but the cache is empty so -1 is returned.\n",
    "At t=250, count() returns 0 because the cache is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0 <= key, value <= 109\n",

    "    0 <= timeDelays[i] <= 1450\n",
    "    actions[i] is one of \"TimeLimitedCache\", \"set\", \"get\" and \"count\"\n",
    "    First action is always \"TimeLimitedCache\" and must be executed immediately, with a 0-millisecond delay\n",
