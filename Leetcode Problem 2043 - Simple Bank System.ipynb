    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been tasked with writing a program for a popular bank that will automate all its incoming transactions (transfer, deposit, and withdraw). The bank has n accounts numbered from 1 to n. The initial balance of each account is stored in a 0-indexed integer array balance, with the (i + 1)th account having an initial balance of balance[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute all the valid transactions. A transaction is valid if:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The given account number(s) are between 1 and n, and\n",
    "    The amount of money withdrawn or transferred from is less than or equal to the balance of the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the Bank class:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bank(long[] balance) Initializes the object with the 0-indexed integer array balance.\n",
    "    boolean transfer(int account1, int account2, long money) Transfers money dollars from the account numbered account1 to the account numbered account2. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.\n",
    "    boolean deposit(int account, long money) Deposit money dollars into the account numbered account. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.\n",
    "    boolean withdraw(int account, long money) Withdraw money dollars from the account numbered account. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.\n",
