    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two integers n and k and two integer arrays speed and efficiency both of length n. There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n. speed[i] and efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency of the ith engineer respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose at most k different engineers out of the n engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of a team is the sum of its engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among its engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum performance of this team. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n",

    "Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2\n",
    "Output: 60\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.\n",

    "Explanation:\n",
    "This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team. That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.\n",
