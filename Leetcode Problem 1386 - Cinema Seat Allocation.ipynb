    "A cinema has n rows of seats, numbered from 1 to n and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from 1 to 10 as shown in the figure above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the array reservedSeats containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, reservedSeats[i] = [3,8] means the seat located in row 3 and labelled with 8 is already reserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum number of four-person groups you can assign on the cinema seats. A four-person group occupies four adjacent seats in one single row. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case on which an aisle split a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split a four-person group in the middle, which means to have two people on each side.\n",
