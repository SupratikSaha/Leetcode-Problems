    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k.\n",
    "\n",
    "A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. In one round, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.\n",
    "    Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, \"346\" is replaced with \"13\" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.\n",
    "    Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return s after all rounds have been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"11111222223\", k = 3\n",
    "Output: \"135\"\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: \"111\", \"112\", \"222\", and \"23\".\n",
    "  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. \n",
    "  So, s becomes \"3\" + \"4\" + \"6\" + \"5\" = \"3465\" after the first round.\n",
    "- For the second round, we divide s into \"346\" and \"5\".\n",
    "  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. \n",
    "  So, s becomes \"13\" + \"5\" = \"135\" after second round. \n",
    "Now, s.length <= k, so we return \"135\" as the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"00000000\", k = 3\n",
    "Output: \"000\"\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "We divide s into \"000\", \"000\", and \"00\".\n",
    "Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. \n",
    "s becomes \"0\" + \"0\" + \"0\" = \"000\", whose length is equal to k, so we return \"000\".\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 <= s.length <= 100\n",
    "    2 <= k <= 100\n",
    "    s consists of digits only."
