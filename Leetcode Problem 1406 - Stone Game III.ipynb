    "    Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2 or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The score of each player is the sum of values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return \"Alice\" if Alice will win, \"Bob\" if Bob will win or \"Tie\" if they end the game with the same score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: values = [1,2,3,7]\n",
    "    Output: \"Bob\"\n",
    "    Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: values = [1,2,3,-9]\n",
    "    Output: \"Alice\"\n",
    "    Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.\n",
    "    If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.\n",
    "    If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.\n",
    "    Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: values = [1,2,3,6]\n",
    "    Output: \"Tie\"\n",
    "    Explanation: Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: values = [1,2,3,-1,-2,-3,7]\n",
    "    Output: \"Alice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: values = [-1,-2,-3]\n",
    "    Output: \"Tie\"\n",
    "\n",
