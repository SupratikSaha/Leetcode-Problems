    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D integer array relations where relations[j] = [prevCoursej, nextCoursej] denotes that course prevCoursej has to be completed before course nextCoursej (prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a 0-indexed integer array time where time[i] denotes how many months it takes to complete the (i+1)th course.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must find the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses following these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    You may start taking a course at any time if the prerequisites are met.\n",
    "    Any number of courses can be taken at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e., the graph is a directed acyclic graph).\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]], time = [3,2,5]\n",
    "Output: 8\n",
    "Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course. \n",
    "We start course 1 and course 2 simultaneously at month 0.\n",
    "Course 1 takes 3 months and course 2 takes 2 months to complete respectively.\n",
    "Thus, the earliest time we can start course 3 is at month 3, and the total time required is 3 + 5 = 8 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 5, relations = [[1,5],[2,5],[3,5],[3,4],[4,5]], time = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "Output: 12\n",
    "Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course.\n",
    "You can start courses 1, 2, and 3 at month 0.\n",
    "You can complete them after 1, 2, and 3 months respectively.\n",
    "Course 4 can be taken only after course 3 is completed, i.e., after 3 months. It is completed after 3 + 4 = 7 months.\n",
    "Course 5 can be taken only after courses 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been completed, i.e., after max(1,2,3,7) = 7 months.\n",
    "Thus, the minimum time needed to complete all the courses is 7 + 5 = 12 months.\n",
