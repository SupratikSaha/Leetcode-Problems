    "Design a system that manages the reservation state of n seats that are numbered from 1 to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the SeatManager class:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SeatManager(int n) Initializes a SeatManager object that will manage n seats numbered from 1 to n. All seats are initially available.\n",
    "    int reserve() Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.\n",
    "    void unreserve(int seatNumber) Unreserves the seat with the given seatNumber.\n",
