    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two non-negative integer arrays price and tastiness, both arrays have the same length n. You are also given two non-negative integers maxAmount and maxCoupons.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every integer i in range [0, n - 1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "    price[i] describes the price of ith fruit.\n",
    "    tastiness[i] describes the tastiness of ith fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to purchase some fruits such that total tastiness is maximized and the total price does not exceed maxAmount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can use a coupon to purchase fruit for half of its price (rounded down to the closest integer). You can use at most maxCoupons of such coupons.\n",
