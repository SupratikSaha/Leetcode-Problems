    "You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string customers consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y':\n",
    "\n",
    "    if the ith character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the ith hour\n",
    "    whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the ith hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the shop closes at the jth hour (0 <= j <= n), the penalty is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by 1.\n",
    "    For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty.\n",

    "- Closing the shop at the 0th hour incurs in 1+1+0+1 = 3 penalty.\n",
    "- Closing the shop at the 1st hour incurs in 0+1+0+1 = 2 penalty.\n",
    "- Closing the shop at the 2nd hour incurs in 0+0+0+1 = 1 penalty.\n",
    "- Closing the shop at the 3rd hour incurs in 0+0+1+1 = 2 penalty.\n",
    "- Closing the shop at the 4th hour incurs in 0+0+1+0 = 1 penalty.\n",
    "Closing the shop at 2nd or 4th hour gives a minimum penalty. Since 2 is earlier, the optimal closing time is 2.\n",
