    "    Problem Statement.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.\n",
    "        A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\n",
    "        A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.\n",
    "        A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.\n",
    "        A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\n",
    "        A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\n",
    "        The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.\n",
    "        CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Input: code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\n",
    "    Output: true\n",
    "    Explanation: \n",
    "    The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \n",
    "    The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \n",
    "    Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\n",
    "    So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Input: code = \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\n",
    "    Output: true\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "    We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\n",
    "    start_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\n",
    "    end_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\n",
    "    tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\n",
    "    text1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\n",
    "    cdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\n",
    "    text2 -> \"]]>>]\"\n",
    "    The reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\n",
    "    The reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 3:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Input: code = \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\n",
    "    Output: false\n",
    "    Explanation: Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Constraints:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        1 <= code.length <= 500\n",
    "        code consists of English letters, digits, '<', '>', '/', '!', '[', ']', '.', and ' '.\n",
    "    \n",
