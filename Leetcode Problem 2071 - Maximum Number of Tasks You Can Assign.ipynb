    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have n tasks and m workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array tasks, with the ith task requiring tasks[i] strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j] strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you have pills magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by strength. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the 0-indexed integer arrays tasks and workers and the integers pills and strength, return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.\n",

    "We can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:\n",
    "- Give the magical pill to worker 0.\n",
    "- Assign worker 0 to task 2 (0 + 1 >= 1)\n",
