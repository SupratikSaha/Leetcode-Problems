    "\n",
    "You are given two strings word1 and word2. You want to construct a string merge in the following way: while either word1 or word2 are non-empty, choose one of the following options:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If word1 is non-empty, append the first character in word1 to merge and delete it from word1.\n",
    "        For example, if word1 = \"abc\" and merge = \"dv\", then after choosing this operation, word1 = \"bc\" and merge = \"dva\".\n",
    "    If word2 is non-empty, append the first character in word2 to merge and delete it from word2.\n",
    "        For example, if word2 = \"abc\" and merge = \"\", then after choosing this operation, word2 = \"bc\" and merge = \"a\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the lexicographically largest merge you can construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b. For example, \"abcd\" is lexicographically larger than \"abcc\" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.\n",
